# 🔒 Security Policy

Thank you for your interest in the security of the **NBA Awards Predictor** project.
This document outlines the security practices of the repository and how to responsibly report vulnerabilities.

## 🛡️ Repository security

This repository relies on GitHub’s built-in security features for public projects.

### ✅ Dependabot alerts
Dependabot is enabled to:
- detect vulnerabilities in Python dependencies,
- propose secure dependency updates automatically.

### 🔍 Secret scanning
GitHub automatically scans the repository for:
- API keys,
- access tokens,
- passwords accidentally committed.

### 🚫 Push protection
Push protection prevents accidental commits containing:
- secrets,
- credentials,
- personal access tokens.

If a secret is detected, the push is blocked automatically.

### 🧪 Code scanning (CodeQL)
When enabled, GitHub CodeQL can analyze Python code to detect:
- common vulnerabilities,
- unsafe patterns,
- logic errors.
